We extract 1 track at random per class for validation, yielding 1,290 samples for validation and 25,350 for training\n",

    "- we build a jittered dataset by adding 5 transformed versions of the original training set, yielding 126,750 samples in total. Samples are randomly perturbed in position ([-2,2] pixels), in scale ([.9,1.1] ratio) and rotation ([-15,+15] degrees).\n",
